Collections Practice
We have discussed how array, list, and dictionaries all can be used, but its about time we put some of this knowledge into action. The following things should just be created in a new .NET project and uploaded at the end.

Three Basic Arrays
Create an array to hold integer values 0 through 9
Create an array of the names "Tim", "Martin", "Nikki", & "Sara"
Create an array of length 10 that alternates between true and false values, starting with true
Multiplication Table
Use a multidimensional array to store all values

List of Flavors
Create a list of Ice Cream flavors that holds at least 5 different flavors (feel free to add more than 5!)
Output the length of this list after building it
Output the third flavor in the list, then remove this value.
Output the new length of the list (Note it should just be one less~)

User Info Dictionary
Create a Dictionary that will store both string keys as well as string values
For each name in the array of names you made previously, add it as a new key in this dictionary with value null
For each name key, select a random flavor from the flavor list above and store it as the value
Loop through the Dictionary and print out each user's name and their associated ice cream flavor.
