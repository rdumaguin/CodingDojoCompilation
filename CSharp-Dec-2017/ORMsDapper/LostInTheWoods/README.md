Lost in the Woods

For this assignment we will be practicing our newly learned knowledge of Dapper by build an app that showcases various Hiking trails. This app will have a list of hiking trails that each have a few properties: Trail Name, Description, Trail Length, Elevation Gain, Longitude and Latitude. All trails are listed on a main page with the ability to add new trails as well as Navigate to each trail's individual information page. The wireframe for the assignment is provided below

-Create a main page that list all Trails and their Name, Length, and Elevation Change properties
-Button to a Trail Add page that allows you to create new trails with all required fields
-Trail Creation should have corresponding validations for each field
-Clicking a trail name from main page redirects to the trails show page where all information regarding that trail is listed
