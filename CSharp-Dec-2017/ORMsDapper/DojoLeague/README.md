The Dojo League

For this assignment we will be building another CRUD application that will put to test our skills with Dapper (or Entity Framework) relationships. We are going to build a site that tracks various Ninjas and the Dojos they are currently training under. For this the following things are required.

Create a "Ninjas" page
-Have a List of all ninjas and the dojos they are a part of. If they are not yet part of a dojo it should list them as "Rogue"
-On this same page there should be a section to register new ninjas
-Newly registered ninjas require a name, a level between 1 & 10, an assigned Dojo (or Rogue), and optionally a description
-Ninja and Dojo names should be links to their respective show pages

Create a "Dojos" page
-Have a List of all dojos all of which are clickable links to individual show pages
-Have a form for creating a new Dojo. This form should include fields for Name, Location, and Additional Information all with their respective validations

Create a show page for a single Ninja
-The page should include the ninja's name, level, and description
-It should also contain a note of their current dojo as a link or list them as "Rogue"

Create a show page for a single Dojo
-This page should include all information about the Dojo including Name, Location, and Information
-It should include a list of all ninjas currently part of the dojo including a button to "Banish" them; removing their association with that dojo.
-All Ninjas currently not part of a dojo (AKA Rogue) should also be listed with the ability to "Recruit" them, thereby adding them to the current dojo roster
