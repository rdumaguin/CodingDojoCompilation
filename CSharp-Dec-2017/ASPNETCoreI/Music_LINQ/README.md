Music LINQ
With our new found knowledge of LINQ, we can now parse through large sets of data stored in any type of collection. For this assignment we will have a List of Artist objects and a List of Group objects to work through. By using various LINQ methods we can get a lot of interesting information from our two collections to solve various problems. Note that for the purpose of staying focused in solely on practicing LINQ, we have provided some starter code for this assignment. In the Program.cs file's Main function we have already set up the two collections which are what all your queries should be based on. The Artist class file and Group Class file are also provided for reference to their various properties.
