Portfolio

We should practice our ability of including static files such as CSS, JS, or IMGs. To do this we are going to create a simple portfolio website that contains 3 key pages. These pages will be a home page that is mostly personal information, a projects page that lists various projects you have worked on, and a contact page with a form where people visiting your website can send you information. There will also be a navbar at the top of each of these pages with buttons that will allow you to navigate to the various other pages. For this assignment, it is critical to be adding CSS styling to each page and using only images that are stored on your local server in the wwwroot directory!

-Create three different routes for this Project: Home, Projects, and Contact
-There should be a navbar with tabs to each section displayed at the top
-The Home page should have a picture, name, and about me section
-The Project page should have at least 3 Projects listed each with a Title, Image , and small description
-The Contact page should consist just of a contact form with a input for name, email, and their message
-Remember all pages should have some styling!!
