The Wall

Now that we have created an assignment where a user can register and login to our site, let's combine this idea with our previous messaging assignment "Quoting Dojo". Create a wall/forum page where users will be able to post a message and see the message displayed by other users. Store the messages in a table called 'messages' and retrieve the messages from the database. Have a Login and Registration page. After logging in, the user is directed to The Wall.

Once you got the messages to show up like on the wireframe on the left side, allow users to post comments for any message. Store the replies/comments to the message in a separate table called 'comments'.
